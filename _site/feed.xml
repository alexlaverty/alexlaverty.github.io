<p>Went down down to Manly Beaches South Steyne and took some video of the event, also at the end of the video some bonus footage of an electric hydrofoil surf boarder.</p>

<p>Some information about the Fight for The Bight campaign :</p>

<p>“The Bight supports wild fisheries and aquaculture ventures worth around $440 million for each annum (2012–13) and travel industry enterprises worth around $1.2 billion for every annum (2013–14).</p>

<p>Flanked by the Nullarbor and the longest ceaseless ocean precipices on the planet, the Bight is a safe house for whales, fish, feathered creatures, marine warm blooded creatures, plants life and a variety of invertebrate environments.</p>

<p>The territory has nutrient upwellings which give basic environment to innumerable species including a portion of the final settlements of jeopardized Australian ocean lions.</p>

<p>Researchers gauge around 85% of the species that live in the Great Australian Bight are discovered no place else on Earth.</p>

<p>What befalls the earth of the Bight influences the assorted variety of the marine world on a worldwide scale.</p>

<p>The dangers presented by opening the Bight to oil investigation are unsatisfactory. Not exclusively is there potential for a cataclysmic oil slick, the ineffectively comprehended impacts of seismic testing, strike hazard and commotion contamination from penetrating and vessel traffic, and expanded contamination can possibly in a general sense upset this one of a kind marine condition.”</p>]]></content><author><name>alexlaverty</name></author><category term="manly-beach" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today was the Fight For The Bight demonstration where a large group of surfers paddled out into the ocean and formed a large circle to protest a Norwegian oil company called Equinor who want to create a deep-sea drilling operation in the Great Australian Bight off the coast of South Australia.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/images/2019-11-23/fftb.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/images/2019-11-23/fftb.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Manly Beach Friday 28th June 2019</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/Friday-28th-June-2019" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Manly Beach Friday 28th June 2019" /><published>2019-06-28T10:00:00+10:00</published><updated>2019-06-28T10:00:00+10:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/Friday-28th-June-2019</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/Friday-28th-June-2019"><![CDATA[<p>Was up early this morning so I thought I’d head down to Manly Beach to take some photos, I haven’t had a chance to get out in a long time so was good to get out.</p>

<p>There was a 4 metre swell that came through today around lunch time, the swell forecast said the cause of it was :</p>

<p>“a front sweeping across Bass Strait forms a rapidly deepening low off the far southern the NSW coast on Monday night. The subsequent increase in southerly-storm swell is looking about as steep as it gets – and the gale-force southerly change preceding the increase will also be strong enough to wreak serious havoc across the coastal fringes as it kicks in at 30 to 45 knots early on Tuesday morning.”</p>

<p>I absolutely love days like this, nothing more exciting then watching massive waves roll in to the shore.</p>

<p>When the swell gets this large around Manly, Deadmans is the only real place that is surfable, all the sand breaks get washed out.</p>

<p>At about midday I headed over to Shelly Beach lookout, from their you can see the surf spot named Deadmans which only breaks in big swell.</p>

<p>It was raining and cold and I thought there would only be a few people there, when I got there the car park was full and a crowd had formed at each of the lookouts.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2019-06-04/seabreeze.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>During the video at about 1:11 you can see a huge set marching in, they didn’t quite break well enough for anyone to catch them but when they broke on the rock platform they barrelled and the lip of the wave was thick and heavy.</p>

<p>I took my DSLR with me and my 300mm Canon lense, my hands were freezing and was hard to keep the camera steady but I still managed to get some good video!</p>]]></content><author><name>alexlaverty</name></author><category term="deadmans" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[These are the biggest waves I’ve seen breaking at Deadmans in person.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">SEA LIFE Sydney Aquarium</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/Sea-Life-Sydney-Aquarium" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="SEA LIFE Sydney Aquarium" /><published>2018-04-28T20:00:00+10:00</published><updated>2018-04-28T20:00:00+10:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/Sea-Life-Sydney-Aquarium</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/Sea-Life-Sydney-Aquarium"><![CDATA[<p>Taking Harry To The Aquarium</p>
