# Cardiovascular & Endurance Tests
- VO2 Max Test (Gold standard for cardiorespiratory fitness)
  - Metric: ml/kg/min of oxygen consumption
  - Higher scores correlate with lower mortality risk

- 6-Minute Walk Test
  - Metric: Distance covered in 6 minutes
  - Predicts functional decline and mortality in older adults

- Stair Climb Test
  - Metric: Time to climb 4 flights of stairs
  - Under 1 minute indicates good cardiac health

# Strength & Power Tests
- Continuous Pushups
  - Metric: Number of proper form pushups
  - Strong indicator of overall muscular endurance

- Grip Strength
  - Metric: Force in kilograms using dynamometer
  - Powerful predictor of mortality and disability

- 30-Second Chair Stand
  - Metric: Number of stands from sitting position
  - Assesses lower body strength and endurance

- Dead Hang Test
  - Metric: Time hanging from pull-up bar
  - Indicates upper body strength and shoulder health

# Balance & Coordination Tests
- One Leg Stand (Eyes Open and Closed)
  - Metric: Time maintaining balance
  - Less than 20 seconds indicates fall risk

- Tandem Walk Test
  - Metric: Walking heel-to-toe in straight line
  - Assesses dynamic balance and coordination

- Functional Reach Test
  - Metric: Distance reached forward while standing
  - Predictor of fall risk

# Flexibility & Mobility Tests
- Sit and Reach
  - Metric: Distance reached past toes
  - Indicates hamstring and lower back flexibility

- Shoulder Mobility Test
  - Metric: Ability to touch hands behind back
  - Assesses upper body mobility

- Thomas Test
  - Metric: Hip flexor flexibility
  - Important for posture and back health

# Functional Movement Tests
- Sit Rise Test (SRT)
  - Metric: Ability to sit and rise from floor using minimal support
  - Each point lost correlates with mortality risk

- Timed Up and Go (TUG)
  - Metric: Time to stand, walk 3m, return and sit
  - Predicts fall risk and functional decline

- Five Times Sit-to-Stand
  - Metric: Time to complete 5 chair stands
  - Assesses lower body strength and power

# Body Composition Metrics
- Waist-to-Height Ratio
  - Metric: Waist circumference divided by height
  - Should be less than 0.5 for optimal health

- Body Fat Percentage
  - Metric: Percentage of body mass that is fat
  - Important indicator of metabolic health

- Muscle Mass Index
  - Metric: Muscle mass relative to height
  - Low scores indicate sarcopenia risk

# Cognitive-Physical Tests
- Reaction Time Test
  - Metric: Time to respond to visual/auditory stimulus
  - Indicates neurological health

- Dual-Task Walking Test
  - Metric: Ability to walk while performing cognitive task
  - Predicts cognitive decline and fall risk

# Recovery Tests
- Heart Rate Recovery
  - Metric: Heart rate decrease 1 minute post-exercise
  - Drop of 12+ beats indicates good fitness

- Heart Rate Variability (HRV)
  - Metric: Variation in time between heartbeats
  - Higher variability indicates better health

# Performance Standards
Excellent scores by age group and gender should be provided for each test. Regular retesting (every 3-6 months) is recommended to track progress and identify areas needing attention.

# Test Protocol Guidelines
1. Perform tests in the morning when fresh
2. Maintain consistent testing conditions
3. Record detailed metrics for tracking
4. Use standardized equipment when possible
5. Have a spotter present for safety when needed
