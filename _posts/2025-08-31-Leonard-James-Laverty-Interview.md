An interview with my grandfather Leonard James Laverty

{% include youtube.html id='md4Inav6W9Q' %}

Here’s a list of the points from the interview :

---

### Transport in the 1920s–30s

* Limited transport options for pioneers.
* Main means of transport: horse (used for riding or as a pack horse).
* Wealthier families used buggies, which could carry 6 passengers.
* Roads were rough (like goat tracks), often blocked by fallen trees or cattle.
* Travelers carried axes, saws, chains, and shovels to clear roads.
* Early motor cars began to appear but were rare.
* No tractors — farm work was done with bullock teams (14–16 bullocks).
* Bullock teams hauled logs and timber to wharves for shipping to Sydney.
* Farmers shipped corn to Sydney, but after costs only earned about sixpence per bushel.

---

### School Life

* Children milked cows before school (took 1–1.5 hours).
* Walked 2 miles barefoot to school, even in frost (shoes came later).
* Played on a slippery track home; injuries were common.
* School had \~35 children, one teacher, and one building.
* Classroom: blackboard, chalk (sometimes thrown at students), slates with slate pencils.
* Later used pen and ink with inkwells built into desks.
* Teachers used canes for discipline, though some students avoided it by helping teachers.

### Home & Family

* Family of 8 brothers (1 died in infancy) and 4 sisters.
* House: large, well-built, 4 bedrooms with verandah, still standing after 100 years.
* Children shared beds (2–3 per bed).
* Blankets scarce — mother sewed corn sacks into quilts.

---

### Farm & Work

* Family raised cattle, grew corn, later started dairying.
* All family members (except father) milked cows by hand.
* A good milker could milk a cow in \~3 minutes.
* Herds ranged from 30–100 cows; milking could take 2 hours.
* Milk separated by hand-cranked machine (separator) into cream and skim milk.
* Cream sent to factory for butter (collected by carrier with horse and wagon, not trucks).
* Skim milk fed to pigs and calves (taught to drink from buckets using a finger trick).

---

### Food & Cooking

* Cooking done on wood stoves and camp ovens.
* Homemade bread baked every second day.
* Butter churned by hand with a butter churn.
* Grew their own vegetables (corn, pumpkins, potatoes, melons, etc.).
* Sweet corn (called “mai” from Aboriginal name) cooked with corned beef.
* No electricity or gas in the bush.

---

### Entertainment

* No TV or electricity.
* Played mouth organ, fiddle, and held “surprise parties” with music and dancing.
* Used kerosene or grease on floors for dancing.

---

### Toilets

* School: pit toilets (deep holes, lime added, never emptied).
* Toilet paper not available — newspapers used instead.
* Home: pan toilet outside, used in all weather.

---

### Clothing & Supplies

* Clothes ordered from Sydney stores via catalogues (e.g., David Jones).
* Orders sent by post; delivery by ship took 1–2 weeks.

---

### Childhood Memories

* Best memories: swimming, fishing, shooting pigeons and turkeys (not protected back then).
* Brothers often brought home game for food.

Would you like me to **condense this further into a short summary** (like a one-page school report style), or keep it as a **detailed bullet list** like above?
