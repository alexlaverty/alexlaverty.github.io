Was having fun using Roo Code to work on this website but I seem to have blasted through the free tier of multiple LLM providers so now Im back to using the UI to code.

Cant wait for the day when you can run a really good local model with unlimited use.

Did some vibe coding today with Google Gemini Pro, created some python code that will scrape Coles prices from their website and write them into a local database. Then a Streamlit Web UI to display the products and the prices by day. Have added a table that will display all the products and their prices per day and then colour code the cell backgrounds so that the cheaper the price the greener the colour, the more expensive the more red it will be, the goal with this code will be for the products that I regularly buy figure out the cheapest time to buy them, base off other price charts I've seen Coles regularly raises and lowers prices in a rhythm.

If you install the "Coles Trend" Chrome plugin and then browse a product on the website you can see the historical price of the product, you can see how they increase and decrease up and down on the same price :

While working on this I also came across the website :
https://www.grocerize.com.au/

Which looked pretty good comparing Woolworths and Coles prices, but when I went to sign up it wants you to pay a subscription, so instead I will build my own and opensource the code.
