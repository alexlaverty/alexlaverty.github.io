What happens when you give a bunch of LLM's a task to make money and work together :

Did a bit more work on scraping Coles prices and saving them into my database :

Currently this page I define a list of products, it will display the price per day for each product on a line chart with a separate line for the grand total of these products. 

I'm going to add in the ingredients for my Longevity Stew, a recipe I used ChatGPT DeepResearch mode to generate, I asked it to generate the healthiest meal it could that I could prepare in my InstantPot pressure cooker that would cover all the essential vitamins and minerals a person requires, it then spent 10 minutes researching and also writing python scripts to calculate amounts etc, you can see the recipe here, I added some additional optional toppings for extra nutrition :

Now using the Coles price scraper I can also optimize this recipe for cost, when best to purchase these ingredients when they're at their lowest price.

I also intend on feeding this data into AI to help me identify patterns of how Coles fluctuates their prices.

## AI Generated About.md 

If you've used ChatGPT for a long time, it's always fun to prompt it with requests that start with :

"Based off all of our last converstations...." 

for example :

## Based off all of our last converstations write an about.md for my Jekyll blog :

### About Me

Hi, I’m glad you’ve found your way here.  

I work in **big data engineering** by day, building scalable platforms that handle massive amounts of information. But outside of work, I’m passionate about exploring ideas and projects that connect technology, creativity, and the natural world.  

This blog is a space where I share my journey—mixing experiments in **coding, AI, and automation** with reflections on **surfing, bonsai, permaculture, and off-grid living**. I enjoy building things from scratch, whether it’s a Django app for kids’ education, a minimalist flat-file blog system, or a game that simulates rainwater harvesting and solar-powered living.  

I’m also a dad, and a big part of what I create here is with my son in mind. I want to leave behind stories, tools, and experiments that he—and maybe others—can learn from, play with, and build on. From surfing at the beach, to tending a bonsai tree, to coding a learning app, life is an ongoing practice in curiosity and creativity.  

### What You’ll Find Here
- Notes on **projects in progress** (web apps, games, coding experiments).  
- Reflections on **nature, resilience, and calm**—from permaculture to surfing.  
- Resources and ideas for **learning and teaching kids** with tech.  
- Personal writing I’d like to pass down over the years.  

This blog is my long-term notebook—a place to archive ideas, share experiments, and document the journey of learning, building, and living a little more intentionally.  

If any of these things resonate with you, I’d love to have you along for the ride.

## Based off all of our last conversations generate an image of what you think I look like :

This is what chatgpt generated and I think it's pretty close, tall, thin, Macbook Pro, by the beach surrounded by nature :

## Based off all of our last conversations generate me an image of a Scout patch :

Similarly Chatgpt created a Scout patch for me based off my interests

## Microsoft Teams Ocean Office background

This is the background I use in Microsoft teams 

![](/assets/images/7af9712329874c7dac54356cd7c2e965.png)

I asked Google VEO to animate this image for me, I was hoping to use an animated version of this image as a video background in Microsoft Teams, my prompt was :

"animate this image, water should gently go in and out, trees should gently sway in the breeze"

{% include video.html src="/assets/videos/1b80760963e3493d9a7b22fb50aa68a5.mp4" %}

It looks great and is what I want, however I don't like the fact that the camera angle is panning and zooming in. I asked Google VEO to redo it but the "camera is fixed, do not pan the camera, do not tilt, do not zoom, only animate the water and trees", however after 3 attempts every response has the video angle moving across the screen which is just going to look weird and distracting in teams calls... oh well will have to attempt again later in a future update.
