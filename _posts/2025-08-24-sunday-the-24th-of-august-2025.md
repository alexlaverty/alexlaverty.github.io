What happens when you give a bunch of LLM's a task to make money and work together :

Did a bit more work on scraping Coles prices and saving them into my database :

Currently this page I define a list of products, it will display the price per day for each product on a line chart with a separate line for the grand total of these products. 

I'm going to add in the ingredients for my Longevity Stew, a recipe I used ChatGPT DeepResearch mode to generate, I asked it to generate the healthiest meal it could that I could prepare in my InstantPot pressure cooker that would cover all the essential vitamins and minerals a person requires, it then spent 10 minutes researching and also writing python scripts to calculate amounts etc, you can see the recipe here, I added some additional optional toppings for extra nutrition :

Now using the Coles price scraper I can also optimize this recipe for cost, when best to purchase these ingredients when they're at their lowest price.

I also intend on feeding this data into AI to help me identify patterns of how Coles fluctuates their prices.
