We will use Django Rest Framework as the API framework to interact with this model.

Using API's allows to either add entries in bulk, allow users to export and import from other systems, allow for automation and scheduled data syncing.

To make the API friendly to use we'll provide an API UI :

## Rest API Authentication 

For now we will just use basic authentication, username and password, however in the future we'll implement some better authentication methods like token authentication.

## FitCypher API Curl Commands 

### GET

Curl Command :

```
curl - X GET http: //127.0.0.1:8000/api/entries/ -u your_username:your_password
```

JSON Response :

```
    [{
        "id": 1,
        "user": {
            "id": 1,
            "username": "alex"
        },
        "date": "2025-02-02T07:51:00Z",
        "tracking": "Food",
        "string_value": "Apple",
        "numerical_value": null,
        "notes": "",
        "tags": "",
        "source": "FitCypher"
    }, {
        "id": 2,
        "user": {
            "id": 1,
            "username": "alex"

If you install JQ you can also get pretty printed output via :

```
curl -s -X GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/entries/ -u your_username:your_password | jq
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "user": {
      "id": 1,
      "username": "alex"
    },
    "date": "2025-02-02T07:51:00Z",
    "tracking": "Food",
    "string_value": "Apple",
    "numerical_value": null,
    "notes": "",
    "tags": "",
    "source": "FitCypher"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "user": {
      "id": 1,
      "username": "alex"
    },
    "date": "2025-02-02T07:52:00Z",
    "tracking": "Exercise",
    "string_value": "Push Ups",
    "numerical_value": "10.00",
    "notes": "",
    "tags": "",
    "source": "FitCypher"
  },
  {
    "id": 3,
    "user": {
      "id": 1,
      "username": "alex"
    },
    "date": "2023-10-15T12:00:00Z",
