I'm going to build a fitness and nutrition tracker using Django and document along the way.

The app is going to be called FitCypher and the code will be stored in following github repository :

<https://github.com/alexlaverty/fitcypher>

FitCypher will be hosted on PythonAnywhere free tier for the time being :
