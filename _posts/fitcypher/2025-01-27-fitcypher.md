Welcome to FitCypher! This project aims to create a comprehensive fitness and health tracker using Django. Throughout this journey, I will be blogging about the development process, sharing insights, challenges, and solutions.

## Desired Features

FitCypher will include the following features:

* **Exercise Tracking**: Log and monitor your workouts.
* **Food Tracking**: Keep a detailed record of your dietary intake.
* **Health Biomarkers/Pathology Results**: Track important health metrics and pathology results.
* **Sleep Tracking**: Monitor your sleep patterns and quality.
* **Third Party Integration**: Intergrate with existing third party apps
* **Additional Features**: We will continuously brainstorm and add more features to enhance the user experience.

## Design and Development

The project will be built using the following components:

* **Django Website**: The core of our application, providing a robust and scalable framework.
* **API Layer**: To facilitate communication between the frontend and backend.
* **Database Backend**: For storing all user data securely and efficiently.

## Hosting Considerations

One of the key decisions will be selecting the best hosting solution that is both cost-effective and scalable. This will ensure that FitCypher can grow and adapt to increasing user demands.

Stay tuned for more updates as we embark on this exciting journey to create FitCypher!
