### **Genealogical Report: The Cook (Koch), Coulter, Laverty, and McGree Families of New South Wales**

This report details the history of several interconnected families—the Koch (later Cook), Coulter, Laverty, and McGree families—who emigrated from Europe in the mid-19th century and settled in the Mid North Coast region of New South Wales, primarily around the Macleay and Nambucca Rivers, including areas like Stuart's Point and Taylors Arm.

#### **Early History and Immigration (1825 - 1865)**

*   **27 May 1825 – Birth of Johann Peter Koch:**
    Johann Peter Koch was born in Mannheim, Baden-Württemberg, Germany. His father was Johann Georg Koch.

*   **c. 1830 – Birth of Anna Katharina Schroder:**
    Anna Katharina Schroder was born in Wanstadt, Baden, Germany, to Catherine and Jacob Schroeder.

*   **12 August 1852 – Marriage of Koch and Schroder:**
    Johann Peter Koch married Anna Katharina Schroder in Wallstadt, Baden-Württemberg, Germany.

*   **24 September 1852 – Birth of Son, Franz:**
    Their first child, a son named Franz (Frank), was born in Wallstadt, Germany.

*   **29 April 1853 – Arrival in Australia:**
    Peter Koch (aged 28), his wife Anna Catherine (aged 23), and their 7-month-old son Franz arrived in Sydney, Australia. The Hamburg Passenger Lists identify them as departing from Wallstadt, with Peter’s occupation listed as *Weinbauer* (Vinedresser). The official "List of Immigrants" for their ship confirms their names, ages, and religion (Evangelical). The document also notes that Peter's parents (Georg and Elizabeth) were deceased, as was Anna's father (Jacob), though her mother was still alive.
    *   *Note on ship name:* While most documents, including the detailed shipping lists and newspaper arrival notices, name the vessel as the **Triton**, Peter Cook's later Certificate of Naturalization from 1878 lists the ship as the **"Droden"**. This appears to be a clerical error on the naturalization certificate, as the 'Triton' arrival is well-documented.

*   **30 January 1865 – Arrival of Laverty and Coulter Families:**
    The ship **"Saint Hilda"** arrived in Australia carrying assisted immigrant passengers. Among them were:
    *   **The Laverty Family:** Michael Laverty (30, Labourer) and his wife Sarah (28) from County Monaghan, Ireland, with their children Michael (infant, died on the voyage), Dennis (5), Catherine (3), and Sarah (infant).
    *   **William James Coulter (21, Labourer):** From Dromore, County Tyrone, Ireland.

#### **Settlement and Second Generation (1864 - 1900)**

*   **15 July 1864 – Birth of Alfred Henry Cook:**
    Alfred Henry Cook was born in Picton, NSW, to Peter and Anna Catherine Cook. He was the seventh of their twelve children and the last to be born in Picton before the family relocated to the Macleay River district.

*   **6 March 1875 – Birth of Jessie Elvina Coulter:**
    Jessie Elvina Coulter was born to William James Coulter and Emily Gill.

*   **24 August 1878 – Naturalization of Peter Cook:**
    Peter Cook, now residing in the Macleay River district and working as a farmer, was officially naturalized as a British subject in the Colony of New South Wales. The certificate notes he had been a resident for 25 years.

*   **26 June 1891 – Elopement and Marriage of Alfred Cook and Jessie Coulter:**
    Alfred Henry Cook and Jessie Elvina Coulter married in Kempsey. A newspaper article titled "An Elopement Case" details the events leading up to their marriage. Jessie, being under 21, ran away with Alfred because her parents did not approve of the match. She admitted to stealing money from her mother to pay for their travel to Port Macquarie. Alfred was charged and committed to trial after Jessie’s father refused the Police Magistrate's suggestion to withdraw the charge and allow the young couple to marry. Despite this, they did marry. They would go on to have eleven children, including Ethel Stella (b. 1892) and Magnus Victor (b. 1897).

*   **c. 1900 – Political Involvement:**
    A list of committee members for George Stuart Briner, an elector in the Raleigh Electorate, shows the interconnectedness of the families in Lower Taylor's Arm. Signatories pledging their vote include **Alfred Cook**, **Jessie Cook**, **Denis Laverty**, **Michael Laverty**, **John Laverty**, **Samuel Laverty**, and **Peter McGree**.

#### **Early 20th Century and the Great War (1909 - 1920)**

*   **17 November 1909 – Death of Johann Peter Cook:**
    John Peter Cook passed away at his home in Stuart's Point at the age of 84. His obituary in the *Macleay Argus* remembers him as a "very old colonist" and a highly respected figure affectionately known as "Grandfather Cook." A native of Germany, he had lived in NSW for nearly 60 years. He was an earnest member of the Methodist Church and worked for many years as the caretaker of the North Coast Co.'s wharf and shed. His funeral was reportedly the largest ever seen in the area, with 194 relatives present. At the time of his death, he had 10 surviving children, 83 grandchildren, and 22 great-grandchildren.

*   **15 March 1911 – Death of Anna Catherine Cook (née Schroder):**
    Anna Catherine Cook passed away at Kempsey at the age of 81. Her death certificate lists her cause of death as pleurisy and senility. It confirms she was born in Germany, had been in NSW for 58 years, and was buried in the Methodist Cemetery at West Kempsey.

*   **10 October 1911 – Birth of Leonard James Laverty:**
    Leonard James Laverty was born at Taylors Arm, NSW, to Denis and Nora Laverty.

*   **1912 – Marriage of Ethel Cook and Peter McGree:**
    Ethel Stella Cook, daughter of Alfred and Jessie Cook, married Peter McGree, linking the Cook and McGree families.

*   **The McGree Brothers in World War I:**
    The McGree family of Taylors Arm, headed by James and Bridget McGree, made an immense sacrifice during the war, losing three of their four sons who served.
    *   **8 August 1915 – Death of Patrick Joseph McGree:** Private P. J. McGree, serving with the Wellington Regiment of the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF), was killed in action at Chunuk Bair, Gallipoli. He has no known grave and is commemorated on the Chunuk Bair Memorial.
    *   **30 August 1915 – Enlistment of John Ambrose McGree:** Just weeks after his brother's death, John Ambrose McGree enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) in Lismore, NSW. His attestation paper describes him as a 22-year-old farmer.
    *   **26 July 1916 – Death of John Ambrose McGree:** Private J. A. McGree died of wounds received in action in France. A letter dated 29 August 1916 from his mother, Bridget, to Base Records in Melbourne poignantly asks for details of his death: "what were his last words, & where he is buried." A formal reply from Base Records dated 6 September 1916 confirms he died of wounds. He was buried in Warloy-Baillon Military Cemetery.
    *   **20 July 1917 – A Family's Memorial:** A "Roll of Honor" notice was published in the *Nambucca and Bellinger News*, inserted by the soldiers' sister, Mary A. Laverty, in "loving memory of my two brothers, P. J. McGree... and J. A. McGree."
    *   **18 July 1918 – Death of Michael Dennis McGree:** Michael Dennis McGree, also serving with the NZEF, was killed in action in France.

*   **July 1917/August 1920 – Death of Denis Laverty:**
    There is conflicting information regarding the death of Denis Laverty.
    *   An **obituary dated July 20, 1917**, reports the recent death of Mr. Denis Laverty, JP, a well-known Taylors Arm resident, at age 61 due to heart failure. It states he was born in England and settled at Taylors Arm 37 years prior.
    *   A **headstone** for Denis and Nora Laverty records Denis's date of death as **16th August 1920**.
    It's possible these refer to two different men named Denis Laverty, or one of the dates is incorrect.

#### **Mid-20th Century (1923 - 1979)**

*   **1923 – Marriage of Magnus Cook and Mary Laverty:**
    Magnus Victor Cook, son of Alfred and Jessie, married Mary Laverty, further strengthening the bond between the Cook and Laverty families.

*   **29 April 1939 – Death of Alfred Henry Cook:**
    Alfred Cook passed away at age 77 after 12 months of failing health. His obituary notes he was an old resident of the district. His headstone confirms the date.

*   **1941-1946 – World War II Service of Leonard James Laverty:**
    Leonard James Laverty enlisted in the Australian Military Forces on 13 September 1941 at Taylors Arm. He was 29 years old. His service records show periods of duty, leave, and hospitalization. He was court-martialed for desertion (absence without leave from 14 March to 21 March 1946) and was subsequently discharged on 5 April 1946. His reason for discharge is listed as Tachycardia (a rapid heart rate).

*   **23 October 1944 – Death of Nora Laverty:**
    Nora Laverty, wife of Denis, passed away. She is buried alongside him.

*   **21 July 1957 – Death of Jessie Elvina Cook (née Coulter):**
    Jessie Elvina Cook, widow of Alfred, passed away at the age of 82. She is buried with her husband.

*   **26 August 1961 – Death of Denis Laverty:**
    A prayer card commemorates the death of a Denis Laverty on this date. Given the other Denis Laverty died much earlier, this is likely a son or other close relative.

*   **17 March 1970 – Death of Ethel McGree (née Cook):**
    Ethel McGree, wife of Peter McGree and daughter of Alfred and Jessie Cook, passed away at the age of 85.

*   **21 February 1979 – Estate of John Ambrose McGree:**
    A letter from the law firm Hughes, Perkins & Co. was sent to Mrs. E.P. Laverty of Taylors Arm, enclosing a cheque for $200.00 as her entitlement under the will of the late John Ambrose McGree (d. 1916). Mrs. E.P. Laverty was Elsie Pearl McGree, who married Leonard James Laverty.

#### **Late 20th Century and Legacy (1989 - 2007)**

*   **September/October 1989 – Laverty Family Reunion:**
    A major family reunion for all Laverty descendants was held at the Macksville Showground. Newspaper articles from the time state that around 1,000 relatives were expected. The event was organised to celebrate the family's heritage, tracing their roots back to Michael and Sarah Laverty who settled at Pola Creek before taking up land at Taylors Arm.

*   **4 October 1993 – 50th Wedding Anniversary of Len and Elsie Laverty:**
    Leonard "Len" James Laverty and his wife Elsie (née McGree) celebrated their golden wedding anniversary in Grafton. A newspaper article celebrated the occasion, noting they had 11 children, 22 grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.

*   **September/October 1999 – The McGree Brothers' Photographs:**
    Newspaper articles from the *Mid-Coast Observer* detail the end of a year-long search by two men, David Sandground of Melbourne and Michael Long of England, to find the relatives of Patrick and John McGree. They had come into possession of valuable WWI photographs of the brothers. After their search led them to Taylors Arm, an official presentation of the photographs to the McGree family was organised to take place on October 3rd at the famous "Pub with No Beer."

*   **26 June 2007 – A Telling Career:**
    *The Daily Examiner* published a feature article on the life and career of Len Laverty. It detailed his long career with the Commonwealth Bank, from working in the "dungeons" of the head office in Sydney to postings in Papua New Guinea and, finally, Maclean.

*   **Eulogy for Leonard James Laverty:**
    An undated eulogy, presumably written for his funeral, provides a personal portrait of Len Laverty. It describes him as a man with a deep love for the land, developed over 68 years on the family farm at Taylors Arm. He was remembered as generous, dignified, and possessing a great sense of humour. The eulogy also highlights his love of music; at age 19, he and his brothers formed "Laverty's Band," which was very popular in the Nambucca River area, with Len playing the drums, singing, and acting as MC.

### **Summary and Key Points**

*   **Interconnected Pioneer Families:** This collection of documents provides a rich history of the Cook (Koch), Coulter, Laverty, and McGree families. They were pioneers in the regional NSW area of the Macleay and Nambucca Valleys, and their lives became deeply intertwined through marriage, with multiple unions between the Cook, Laverty, and McGree lines.
*   **Immigrant Origins:** The story begins with immigration from Europe: the Koch family from Germany in 1853, and the Laverty and Coulter families from Ireland in 1865. They established themselves primarily through farming and labour.
*   **The Tragedy of War:** A central and poignant theme is the immense sacrifice of the McGree family, who lost three sons—Patrick, John, and Michael—in World War I. The documents, including official records, heartfelt letters, and later newspaper articles, paint a vivid picture of the family's loss and enduring legacy in the Taylors Arm community.
*   **Community and Legacy:** The families were deeply embedded in their local communities, participating in politics, church life, and social events. The 1989 Laverty reunion and the 1999 presentation of the McGree photographs demonstrate a strong, lasting connection to their heritage and the region their ancestors helped build.
