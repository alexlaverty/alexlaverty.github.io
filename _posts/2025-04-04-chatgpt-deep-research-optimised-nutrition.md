Thought I would give ChatGPT's Deep Research option a try today. 

With the Deep Research option instead of asking a question and getting an immediate response, the question is submitted and chatgpt will work on the problem for a number of minutes checking a lot of different sources online and then eventually coming back with an answer, so the deep research prompt I gave it was :


"theoretically based off foods available in coles and woolworths in sydney australia, what is the least amount of ingredients for the least amount of money that would provide all the required micronutrients vitamins and minerals a 39 year old adult male would require to be fit and healthy? give me that list of foods"


## Chatgpt responded with :

To find the cheapest and most minimal list of ingredients from Coles and Woolworths in Sydney that covers all essential micronutrients for a 39-year-old male, could you please clarify the following:

1. Do you have any dietary restrictions (e.g., vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free)?
2. Should this food list cover macronutrients (calories, protein, fat, carbs) too, or only vitamins and minerals?
3. Are you looking for daily consumption cost, or weekly/monthly affordability?
4. Should the diet be sustainable for long-term daily use or is a short-term solution okay?

With that info, I can tailor the food list more accurately to your needs."

## My response :

1. Lactose intolerant 
2. should cover macronutrient requirements and micronutrient requirements
3. lets go daily 
4. short-term"

## Chatgpt :

Great. I’ll look into the cheapest combination of foods available at Coles and Woolworths in Sydney that can meet all the daily macro- and micronutrient requirements for a 39-year-old lactose-intolerant male. This list will prioritize minimal ingredients and low cost while ensuring full nutritional coverage for short-term use.

I'll let you know as soon as I have a complete list ready for you.

## Minimal-Cost Complete Diet (39‑year-old Male, Lactose-Free)

To meet the estimated daily needs of a 39‑year-old male (≈2,300–2,500 kcal) with minimal cost and ingredients, we use inexpensive, nutrient‑dense staples available at Coles/Woolworths. The menu below provides all macronutrients (protein ≈96 g, fat ≈64 g, carbs ≈343 g, fiber ≈67 g) and most essential vitamins/minerals at or above Australian RDI levels (e.g. iron, folate, vitamin C, A, K, B‐vitamins)
healthline.com
medicalnewstoday.com
. (Fiber intake ≈67 g greatly exceeds the 25–30 g recommendation
dietitiansaustralia.org.au
.) All dairy is omitted (or replaced by fortified alternatives). Total cost is roughly $4–5 AUD/day. Key nutrition sources include grains, legumes, eggs and vegetables; citrus fruit supplies vitamin C; iodized salt or seafood can provide iodine. (Calcium from this diet is only ~450 mg – below the ~1,000 mg RDI
betterhealth.vic.gov.au
 – so a calcium-rich add‑on (e.g. fortified soy milk, tofu or supplement) is recommended for longer-term use.)
## Rolled oats (Coles/Woolies brand) – 150 g dry (≈1.5 cups). 
Provides ≈570 kcal, ≈20 g protein, 84 g carbs (≈16 g fiber), 14 g fat
woolworths.com.au
woolworths.com.au
. Rich in complex carbs, fiber and B vitamins. Cost ≈$0.30.
## White rice (medium-grain) – 160 g dry (~0.8 cup). 
Provides ≈570 kcal, ≈11 g protein, 127 g carbs (virtually no fiber)
calorieking.com
. Cheap staple; when combined with lentils yields a complete amino acid profile. Cost ≈$0.25.
## Lentils (dried, split or whole) – 100 g dry. 
Provides ≈350 kcal, ≈26 g protein, 60 g carbs and 30 g fiber
fatsecret.com
. Very high in plant protein, fiber, folate (≈90% DV per cooked cup
healthline.com
) and iron (≈7.5 mg, 42% DV
fatsecret.com
). One of the cheapest protein sources ($0.40/100 g).
## Eggs (large) – 3 eggs (≈150 g). 
Provides ≈230 kcal, 18 g protein, 15 g fat. They deliver high-quality protein and key micronutrients: choline and B12 (≈3–4 μg, >100% RDI), vitamin A, D and E
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. Extremely cost-efficient for protein and vitamins
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. Cost ≈$0.75.
## Peanut butter (smooth) – 2 tbsp (32 g). 
Provides ≈190 kcal, 8 g protein, 16 g fat, 6 g carbs, 2.6 g fiber (per 32 g). Supplies healthy monounsaturated fats plus many micronutrients: vitamin E (≈60% DV/100g), niacin (B3, 84% DV/100g), B6, folate, magnesium (37% DV/100g) and copper, manganese
healthline.com
. (Choose “natural” peanut butter with just peanuts/salt.) Cost ≈$0.17.
## Dark leafy greens (e.g. spinach, kale) – 200 g raw (≈1 large bag frozen). 
Only ≈46 kcal, but very rich in vitamin C, vitamin A (beta-carotene), vitamin K, folate and iron. For example, spinach is “rich in iron, vitamins C and E, potassium, and magnesium”
medicalnewstoday.com
 and provides some calcium (≈100 mg/200g, though absorption is low). Cost ≈$0.80.
## Carrots or mixed vegetables – 200 g raw. 
Adds vitamins (especially A from beta‑carotene), potassium and extra fiber (≈5–6 g). E.g. 200 g carrots give ≈80 kcal. Carrots are very cheap (≈$0.20).
Fruit (citrus) – 2 medium oranges (≈320 g total). Provides ≈150 kcal, ≈146 mg vitamin C (about 2–3× RDI)
healthline.com
, plus some potassium and fiber (8 g). Oranges are inexpensive ($1.60 for two). (Any citrus or other vitamin‑C fruit can substitute; vitamin C is water-soluble so abundant fruit/veg cover it easily
eatforhealth.gov.au
.)
## Yeast spread (Vegemite/nutritional yeast) – 10 g (≈1 tsp). 
Virtually no calories but a very dense source of B‑vitamins. Provides thiamin (B1), riboflavin (B2), niacin (B3) and often added B6/B12. Helps ensure B‑vitamin and B12 intake in this diet. Cost ≈$0.18.
## Iodized salt – ~2 g. 
Supplies iodine (bread is iodized in AUS, but adding iodized salt ensures ~70–140 μg iodine, ~50–100% of RDI). (Alternatively, a small portion of seaweed or canned fish can cover iodine.)
## Macronutrient and Cost Summary: 
The above daily quantities give ≈2330 kcal (≈25% protein, 24% fat, 51% carbs by energy), ~96 g protein, ~64 g fat (mainly unsaturated), ~343 g carbs and ~67 g fiber. Total estimated cost is about $4–5 AUD per day (assuming ~$0.30 oats, $0.25 rice, $0.40 lentils, $0.75 eggs, $0.17 peanut butter, $0.80 greens, $0.20 carrots, $1.60 oranges, $0.18 Vegemite). 
## Micronutrients: This mix covers nearly all RDIs. 
For example, lentils and greens supply ample iron and folate
healthline.com
, oranges and spinach provide vitamin C
eatforhealth.gov.au
medicalnewstoday.com
, carrots and spinach supply provitamin A (vitamin A), and spinach supplies vitamin K and magnesium
medicalnewstoday.com
. Eggs contribute vitamin D, A and B12, peanut butter adds vitamin E, B3, B6 and magnesium
healthline.com
. Fiber intake (~67 g) well exceeds recommendations
dietitiansaustralia.org.au
, benefiting gut health. The only notable shortfall is calcium (≈450 mg); to meet the ~1,000 mg RDI
betterhealth.vic.gov.au
 one could add a calcium-rich item (e.g. 200 mL calcium-fortified soy milk adds ≈200–300 mg, or a serving of tofu/sardines) or consider a supplement if used beyond a few weeks. 
 ## Notes: 
 Prepare legumes and rice in batches (soak lentils 5–10 min, simmer ~20 min). Oats can be cooked as porridge or soaked overnight. Eggs can be boiled or scrambled. Use minimal oil (≈15 g/day) for cooking (adds ~130 kcal as shown). Salt and pepper for seasoning. Vegemite can be spread thinly on toast or stirred into porridge for B‑vitamins. Carrots and oranges add variety and needed vitamins. This regimen prioritizes cost and completeness over taste/variety.
